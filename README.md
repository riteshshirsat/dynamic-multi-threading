multithreading can be effectively utilized to process data categorized by cities. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

Data Structure:

Maintain a dictionary where the key is the city name and the value is a list containing data points associated with that city.
Thread Division:

Determine the number of threads you intend to use.
Divide the data based on cities into chunks that are roughly equal in size. You can achieve this by iterating through the city data dictionary and assigning chunks to another dictionary where the key is the city and the value is a list of lists, each sub-list representing a chunk of data for that city.
When assigning chunks, ensure each chunk has at least one data point to avoid creating empty threads.
Thread Creation and Execution:

Create threads, assigning each thread a function that processes the data chunk along with the city name.
Start all the threads.
Waiting for Completion:

Use a loop to wait for all the threads to finish processing their assigned data chunks.
